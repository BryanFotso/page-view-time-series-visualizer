# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This is the boilerplate for the Page View Time Series Visualizer project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer

This project is focused on visualizing time series data using various plotting techniques. You will work with a dataset containing the daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from **2016-05-09** to **2019-12-03**. The dataset will be analyzed to understand patterns in page views and identify growth trends over the years and months.

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Overview

**Objectives**:
The goal of this project is to use **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize the time series data by performing the following tasks:

- **Task 1**: Import the data from `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv` using **Pandas** and set the index to the **date** column.
- **Task 2**: Clean the data by removing days when the page views were in the **top 2.5%** or **bottom 2.5%** of the dataset.
- **Task 3**: Create a **line plot** using **Matplotlib** that shows the daily page views on the forum from May 2016 to December 2019. 
- **Task 4**: Create a **bar chart** that shows the **average daily page views** for each month, grouped by year.
- **Task 5**: Create **box plots** to show the distribution of page views by year and month. This helps in analyzing trends and seasonality.
